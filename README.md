# Lecture 3: Getting Started with VR Development

In this lecture, I will introduce the VR development pipeline and demonstrate how to create simple virtual environments using the Godot Engine.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this lecture, you will first need to install:

- [Godot Engine 4.6](https://godotengine.org/) -  We will be using the standard version in class, which only supports GDScript. However, you may optionally install the .NET version if you would also like to use C# in your assignments.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I also recommend you install the following useful VS Code extensions:

- [godot-tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geequlim.godot-tools) - Make sure you use "Open Folder" and select your entire project folder for this to work properly!
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - Useful for source control within VS Code.

## Notes

Godot has an integrated code editor. This is the default option when editing scripts, and it works quite well. However, if you prefer to use VS Code or another external IDE, you can set the path in Editor_>Editor Settings->Text Editor->External.
